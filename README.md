# top_pot

This code starts out by creating a constructor function that defines 
common properties for all Top Pot locations. 

I then define a function that takes a random amount of foot traffic 
based off of the averages in each store. I then create a new 
function that uses the previous one, and finds how many donuts
per any random hour are needed for that particular location.

After creating an instance of the constructor function for each 
location, I created a report function that uses a for-loop to 
assign a different random amount of donuts needed for each 
hour that that particular location is open. 


There were no collaborators on the assignment, but I did seek 
assistance from the instructors at times to help de-bug my
code. 

I referenced for-loops I had made in codecademy to help me better 
understand how I need to write the for-loop for this code.
